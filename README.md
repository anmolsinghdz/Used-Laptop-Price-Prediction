## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the price of a used laptop based on its specifications. This can assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in the second-hand laptop market.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Model Training**: Implementing regression algorithms to predict laptop prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features of laptops such as:

- **Brand**: Manufacturer of the laptop.
- **Model**: Specific model name or number.
- **Processor**: Type and speed of the CPU.
- **RAM**: Size of the Random Access Memory.
- **Storage**: Type (HDD/SSD) and capacity.
- **Graphics Card**: GPU details.
- **Screen Size**: Display size in inches.
- **Operating System**: OS installed on the laptop.
- **Age**: Age of the laptop in years.
- **Condition**: Physical and functional condition of the laptop.

*Note: Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed appropriately before training the model.*

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code development and analysis.
